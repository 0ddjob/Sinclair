# Keyboard Design Files
There are three layouts I've designed:
- 7u space bar (same as original Z88)
- 6.25u space bar/1.75u CAPS LOCK (more common space bar length today?)
- Cursors arranged as inverted T

## [Keyboard Layout Editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/f5774ed0544e4333186cfc4f175c03b7)
Files generated after designing the layout.<br>

## [Plate & Case Builder](http://builder.swillkb.com)
Copy the raw JSON from the layout editor to generate a plate layout & case.<br>
The plate layout can be imported into KiCad to simplify the key switch placement.<br>
