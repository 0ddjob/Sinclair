# Z88 Mechanical Keyboard
I've not had too much luck with the keyboard on my Z88 - seems a bit flaky after 40-odd years.  So I thought I'd try to create a mechanical replacement.<br>

I've modified the layout slightly to improve the arrangement - the cursors are now a "proper" inverted-T layout.<br>

## Layout
The layout almost matches a modern set of keycaps, apart from the custom ones.<br>
By this, I mean the SHIFTED characters on each key match a modern keyboard so a generic set of key caps, plus some blanks, should work.<br>

## Construction
The board is designed to use Gateron Low Profile (KS-33) type key switches with Cherry MX-style key caps.<br>

- 64 key switches
- 53 x 1u
- 5 x 1u blank (INDEX, MENU, HELP, SQUARE, CAPS LOCK)
- 1 x 1.25x2u (ISO ENTER)
- 1 x 1.5u (TAB)
- 1 x 1.75u (DIAMOND/blank)
- 2 x 2u (SHIFT)
- 1 x 7u (SPACE)
- Cherry stabilisers for 7u SPACE bar
- 2 x 8-pin thin film connectors (e.g. TE Connectivity/AMP 5-520314-8)
- 2 x 8-pin strips of thin film cables (e.g. Parlex PSR1635-08)

## Status
1-Jul-2025: Work in progress<br>
3-Jul-2025: Added 6.25u space bar layout<br>
4-Jul-2025: Added inverted-T cursor layout<br>
5-Jul-2025: Inverted-T cursor design routed, ready for test fabrication<br>
7-Jul-2025: Design tweaked, sent to PCBWAY for test fabrication<br>
12-Jul-2025: Test PCBs shipped from PCBWAY<br>
25-Jul-2025: Test PCBs arrived, working!!, need to adjust size of PCB slightly ... maybe (see [video](https://youtu.be/vxIY81ir3Ao))<br>
