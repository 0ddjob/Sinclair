# Z88 Mechanical Keyboard
I've not had too much luck with the keyboard on my Z88 - seems a bit flaky after 40-odd years.  So I thought I'd try to create a mechanical replacement.<br>

Not sure if it'll work - still need to figure out the mounting points, plus also try to get it all routed.<br>

## Layout
The layout almost matches a modern set of keycaps, apart from the custom ones.

- 1 x 1.5u (TAB)

- 1 x 7u (SPACE)
