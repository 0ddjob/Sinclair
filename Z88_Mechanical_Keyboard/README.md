# Z88 Mechanical Keyboard
I've not had too much luck with the keyboard on my Z88 - seems a bit flaky after 40-odd years.  So I thought I'd try to create a mechanical replacement.<br>

I've modified the layout slightly to improve the arrangement - the cursors are now a "proper" inverted-T layout.

## Layout
The layout almost matches a modern set of keycaps, apart from the custom ones.<br>
By this, I mean the SHIFTED characters on each key match a modern keyboard so a generic set of key caps, plus some blanks, should work.

## Construction
I think Gateron Low Profile (KS-33) type key switches should work.

- 64 key switches
- 53 x 1u
- 5 x 1u blank (INDEX, MENU, HELP, SQUARE, CAPS LOCK)
- 1 x 1.25x2u (ISO ENTER)
- 1 x 1.5u (TAB)
- 1 x 1.75u (DIAMOND/blank)
- 2 x 2u (SHIFT)
- 1 x 7u (SPACE)
- Stabilisers for 2u & 7u key caps
