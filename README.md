# Sinclair
Projects for Sinclair computers (ZX80, ZX81, TS1000, TS1500, TS2068, Spectrum and clonesn such as the Minstrel 2 & 3).

## Note
These projects maybe work-in-progress and thus not completed or fully tested!

# TS1500 Extender
The Timex Sinclair TS1500 is a 16KB ZX81/TS1000 in a Spectrum-style case.  As such the expansion port can use full-width expansions due to the power & cassette ports.  This project aims to create an extender to allow full-width expansion (i.e. ZXpand) to be used.

# ZX80 Gaming Keyboard
The cursor keys on a ZX80/ZX81 are the 5/6/7/8 numeric keys along the top row.  My simple brain can't readily adapt to this in games like ZX80 KONG or PACMAN so this is just a ZX80/ZX81 compatible keyboard with additional cursor keys.  Designed for use with the Minstrel 2 computer.
