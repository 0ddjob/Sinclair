# Sinclair
Projects for Sinclair computers (ZX80, ZX81, TS1000, TS1500, TS2068, Spectrum and clonesn such as the Minstrel 2 & 3).

## Note
These projects maybe work-in-progress and thus not completed or fully tested!

# [TS1500 Extender](/TS1500_Extender)
The Timex Sinclair TS1500 is a 16KB ZX81/TS1000 in a Spectrum-style case.  As such the expansion port can use full-width expansions due to the power & cassette ports.  This project aims to create an extender to allow full-width expansion (i.e. ZXpand) to be used.

# [ZX80 Gaming Keyboard](/ZX80_Gaming_Keyboard)
The cursor keys on a ZX80/ZX81 are the 5/6/7/8 numeric keys along the top row.  My simple brain can't readily adapt to this in games like ZX80 KONG or PACMAN so this is just a ZX80/ZX81 compatible keyboard with additional cursor keys.  Designed initially for use with the Minstrel 2 computer (ZX80), but can also be used with the ZX80, Minstrel 3/ZX81 and Minstrel 4th/Jupiter Ace.

# [ZX80 Pixel Synch](/ZX80_Pixel_Sync)
Small daughterboard to fix the [ZX80's pixel synchronisation](http://blog.tynemouthsoftware.co.uk/2022/09/minstrel-2-pixel-synchronisation-part-1.html) issue on the Minstrel 2 computer v2.8 or earlier.  I have a v2.6 board.

# [ZX81 RAM Upgrade](/ZX81_RAM_Upgrade)
Yes, yes, it's been done many times before.  Planning a few different versions: 16KB for standard ZX81/TS1000, 32KB with vLA1, 32KB with own PLD.

# [Z88 Serial Port Converter](/Z88_Serial_DE9-to-DB25)
I'm finally getting my hands on a Cambridge Computers Z88.  I realised that the [Universal Backpack Drive (UBPD)](https://www.soigeneris.com/universal-backpack-drive) I have for the NEC-PC8201A will also work on the Z88 but requires a converter board.  It's possible to order one from Soigeneris when you order a UBPD and there is an existing design available on [Github](https://github.com/bkw777/Z88_RS232), but I thought I'd also have a crack at it.
